# Linux-CPU-Scheduling-Project
In this project I worked with a team to implement 2 different CPU scheduling algorithms, First Come First Serve (FCFS) and Shortest Job First (SJF), with the C programming language in a Linux Ubuntu virtual machine terminal and calculated different aspects of each one to determine which one was the better algorithm for a given set of processes.
